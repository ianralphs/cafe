# cafe

This project is a cafe billing system exercise for calculating the cost of a cafe order. It is envisaged that this is just the calculation and data model code around the capture of an order and creation of associated bill. No user functionality is present.

Warning: This is my first scala project and for demonstration/learning purposes. It is likely that the functionality included may not conform to the highest of standards and should not be relied upon for anything other that the demonstration/learning purpose it was created.
